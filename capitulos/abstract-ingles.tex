This project is the result of a collaboration between the \acs{INEF} school and the \acs{GAMMA} investigation center at the \acs{UPM}. This application aims to develop a tool for visualizing sports movements captured through a Motion Capture system, in the \acs{C3D} file format. Additionally, the application provides features for interactive visualization and customization of marker characteristics, enhancing the analysis of captured movements.

This application has been developed in pure Rust.
